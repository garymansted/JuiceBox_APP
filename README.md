**JuiceBox** was the first (2016) fuel price finder *real-time* application released in NSW Australia. 
Built using scraping techniques (xpath drilling) to scrape relevant data from the centralised fuel price server. Users have the ability to search by fuel type along with a distance. Leveraging applicaition deep-linking, JuiceBox also provides directions to the user selected service station, connecting them with the native navigation app - for a seemless experience.<br/> <br/>
